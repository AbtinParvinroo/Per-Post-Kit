System Behavioral
initial dataset and column and name method of scaling -> system -> column in final dataset

inputs
    dataset(csv), column, name of method of scaling(str)(from logging)

system
    from loggings check the scaling or Normalizition method and then reverse it.
    reversed column saved in final dataset

output
    reversed scaling column which saved in final dataset

tools
    scaling_method(must reversed) = {
        Normalizer(L1, L2, Max), Box-Cox Transformation, Yeo-Johnson Transformation,
        Clipping(Winsorizing), StandardScaling, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, MaxAbsScaler,
        PowerTransformer, QuantileTransformer, UnitVectorScaler
    }

    important info one : this tools important configs must taken from user.
    important info two : this tools must developed as methods of one class.
    important info there : if final dataset doesn't exist consider it initial dataset.
    important info four : config is the all important settings should considerd in each method. 

usage example:
    User give feature_column

    system check the logger for name of scaling method
    logger give us StandardScaler

    final column save in the final dataset
