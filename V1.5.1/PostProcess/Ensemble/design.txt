System Behavioral
initial dataset and model and name method of ensemble -> system -> final dataset

inputs

system
    from User config check the settings of user selected method and with that make
    a voting system for combien resualts of them.

output
    final authorized dataset save in the final dataset

tools
    ensemble_method = {
        VotingClassifierAggregator, AveragingRegressor, StackingAggregator, BlendingAggregator
    }

    important info one : this tools important configs must taken from user.
    important info two : this tools must developed as methods of one class.
    important info there : if final dataset doesn't exist consider it initial dataset.
    important info four : config is the all important settings should considerd in each method. 

usage example:
    User give initial dataset and voting method name and config
