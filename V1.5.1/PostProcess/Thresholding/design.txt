System Behavioral
initial dataset and column and name method of encoder -> system -> column in final dataset

inputs
    dataset(csv), column, name of method of threshold(str)(from logging)

system
    from User config check the settings of user selected method and with that build
    a threshold for model

output
    final authorized dataset save in the final dataset

tools
    threshold_method = {
        FixedThreshold, OptimalThreshold, AdaptiveThreshold
    }

    important info one : this tools important configs must taken from user.
    important info two : this tools must developed as methods of one class.
    important info there : if final dataset doesn't exist consider it initial dataset.
    important info four : config is the all important settings should considerd in each method. 

usage example:
    User give initial dataset and threshold method name and config(constant value = 0.5)

    final authorized dataset save in the final dataset
