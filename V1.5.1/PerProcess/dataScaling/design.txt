dataset -> systemOne -- preperd dataset --> systemTwo -> final dataset based on first dataset

inputs
    dataset and feature columns name

systems
    systemOne
        User select Scaling method name and with selected method system Scale features
        then make new dataset.

    systemTwo
        User select normalazition method name and with selected method system Scale features
        then replace it on new dataset we made for scaling method and if not exist make new
        dataset.

output
    final dataset

tools
    systemOne
        Scaling methods = {
            StandardScaling, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, MaxAbsScaler,
            PowerTransformer, QuantileTransformer, UnitVectorScaler
        }

    systemTwo
        normalazition methods = {
            Normalizer (L1, L2, Max), Box-Cox Transformation,
            Yeo-Johnson Transformation, Clipping (Winsorizing)
        }

    importnant info one: this tools important configs must taken from user.
    important info two : this tools must developed as methods of one class.
    important info there : each system required one class.

usage example:
    we have df, features_name, target_name
    cls=class_name(X=features_name, y=target_name)
    cls.metod(tool_name, config)
