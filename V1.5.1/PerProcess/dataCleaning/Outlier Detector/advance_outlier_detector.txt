column -> simple routine -> outlier Mask

input
column

system
    build a mask from user selected routine with user selected config.

output
    outlier mask

tools
    detection_methods = {
    Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor(LOF), One-Class SVM
    Elliptic Envelope, DBSCAN, CBLOF, COPOD, SOS
    }

    important info one : this tools important configs must taken from user.
    important info two : this tools must developed as methods of one class.

example
    user get the column and LOF method
    user choose n_neighbors = 20, contamination = 0.05

    mask trained.

    mask saved for use in next phase.
