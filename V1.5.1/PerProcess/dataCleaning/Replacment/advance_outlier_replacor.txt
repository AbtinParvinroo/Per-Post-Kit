dataset and mask -> system -> final dataset

inputs
    column and pervius phase's mask

system
    using mask we find the Outliers of the column

    replace them with user selected method

outputs
    final column in final dataset

tools
    replacment_methods = {
        KNN Imputation, Iterative Imputer(MICE), Random Forest Imputation(MissForest),
        GAN Imputation(GAIN), Linear Interpolation, Spline Interpolation
    }

    important info one : this tools important configs must taken from user.
    important info two : this tools must developed as methods of one class.
    important info there : if user didn't choose any method and use the detecting method as well

example
    exaple one
        user get the column and mask but didn't choose any method and mask

        each row with NAN or True Mask fill with detecting mask making technique.

    example two
        user get the column and mask and GAIN method

        each row with NAN or True Mask fill with GAIN with User choosen config.
