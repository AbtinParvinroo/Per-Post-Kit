dataset and method -> system -> final dataset

inputs
dataset

system
statics of methods that user select in each feature calculate and compare with thresholds(thresholds get by config)

outputs
final dataset

tools
    methods = {
        SelectKBest, SelectPercentile, VarianceThreshold, Mutual Information,
        ANOVA F-value, Chi-Square
    }

    important info one : this tools important configs must taken from user.
    important info two : this tools must developed as methods of one class.
    important info there : config for each method describe list of related setting which must consider

example
    User give dataset and method_name as VarianceThreshold with config={Threshold=3}

    each feature's varince calculate and features with less variance deleted.
